# Contributing

## Development Practices and Tooling

We loosely practice [trunk-based-development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/):

- We work almost exclusively on the master branch
- We commit, push, and pull often
- We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run code quality checks at every commit

To manage dependencies and for package distribution we use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) (replaces pip).

We document major features with an example (see metahyper_examples).

## Python Coding Guidelines

- We use relative imports inside our library
- We use the black style with line length 90, enforced by our autoformatter as part of our pre-commit hooks

## Developer Installation

### Miniconda

To manage python versions install e.g., miniconda with

```bash
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O install_miniconda.sh
bash install_miniconda.sh -b -p $HOME/.conda  # Change to place of preference
rm install_miniconda.sh
```

Then run `~/.conda/bin/conda init` or `~/.conda/bin/conda init zsh` and append
`export CONDA_AUTO_ACTIVATE_BASE=false` to your `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`.

Then finally create the environment and activate it

```bash
conda create -n metahyper python=3.7.5
conda activate metahyper
```

### Poetry, pre-commit, and the metahyper Package

First, install poetry, e.g., via

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sdispater/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -O get-poetry.py
python get-poetry.py
rm get-poetry.py
```

Then append to your `.zshrc` / `.bashrc` or run: `export PATH="$HOME/.poetry/bin:$PATH"`

Finally, install the package and pre-commmit hooks

```bash
poetry install
pre-commit install
```

## Tooling Tips

### Add dependencies

To install a dependency use

```bash
poetry add dependency
```

and commit the updated `pyproject.toml` to git.

For more advanced dependency management see examples in `pyproject.toml` or have a look at the [poetry documentation](https://python-poetry.org/).

### Do not run pre-commit hooks

To commit without running `pre-commit` use `git commit --no-verify -m <COMMIT MESSAGE>`.

### Ignore pylint warning

```python
code = "foo"  # pylint: disable=bar
```

Or remove warnings in `pyproject.toml` that we do not consider useful (do not catch bugs, do not increase code quality).

### Do not format with black

```python
x = 2  # fmt: off
```

or for blocks

```python
# fmt: off
x = 2
y = x + 1
# fmt: on
```

### Editorconfig

You might want to install an [editorconfig](https://editorconfig.org/) plugin for your text editor to automatically set line lengths etc.
